# Desert-Walk

In this work, the viewer is able to take control of a figure and walk through a procedurally generated environment.The landscape is programmed to be randomly created so that each experience is different. Every frame of the animation is hand painted with watercolour. I am currently working on asset generation to create a more varied experience.
